This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with mutable maps.  The core issue is that modifying the map while iterating through its entries using `removeIf` on the entry set can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `BuggyMapRemoveIf.kt` file shows the problematic code, while `CorrectedMapRemoveIf.kt` provides a corrected solution using an iterator or creating a copy of the entries.
